  description: At a certain season of our life we are accustomed to consider every spot as the possible site of a house. I have thus surveyed the country on every side within a dozen miles of where I live. In imagination I have bought all the farms in succession, for all were to be bought, and I knew their price. I walked over each farmer's premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry with him, took his farm at his price, at any price, mortgaging it to him in my mind; even put a higher price on it — took everything but a deed of it — took his word for his deed, for I dearly love to talk — cultivated it, and him too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it long enough, leaving him to carry it on.

- name: Chicken
  description: Chicken is an experimental platform that was designed,  developed and tested in a three week sprint. On Chicken users could challenge friends to develop and maintain positive and productive habits through a month long program. For example, a user of Chicken could challenge a friend to go running for at least 3 hours a week for one month. During that month the contestants could record the time spent for every time they went for a run. The person who is closest to their intended goal wins. Users were encouraged to aim high in their estimations to make the challenge a little more interesting.
